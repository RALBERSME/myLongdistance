        <h1>A glimpse into everyday life in Tokyo</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Haru works as a kaishain (office worker) at a medium-sized company in
          the Shinjuku area. His day starts early: he gets up at 6:30, showers,
          and has breakfast (choushoku) with hieta ocha (cold tea) and onigiri
          (rice balls). Then he either takes the basu (bus) or the tetsudo
          (train) to work. The morning hours are often filled with emails and
          meetings. <br /><br />
          The company places great emphasis on yoken (requirements) and no Ki
          (delivery deadlines); Haru checks KPIs (key performance indicators)
          and hinshitsu (quality) daily. During his lunch break, he goes with
          his colleagues to a kinjo no teishoku-ya (nearby set-meal restaurant)
          or to the konbini (convenience store) around the corner. There, he
          usually orders a simple bento box (Japanese lunchbox that transports
          various dishes in separate compartments so they don't mix), with tori
          no teriyaki (chicken in teriyaki style) or yakizakana (grilled fish),
          accompanied by ryokucha (green tea).
          <br /><br />
          After work, Haru often plunges into the hustle and bustle of the
          commute home, whether to Shitamachi or modern districts like Shibuya
          or Otemachi, to meet friends. Sometimes he goes to the gym or takes a
          walk in Yoyogi Park to clear his head. In the evenings, he rarely
          cooks and prefers to prepare for working from home.
          <br /><br />
          At home, he reads some news on his smartphone or listens to music from
          a podcast. Sleep is important, because tomorrow the daily routine with
          colleagues and new clients awaits him again.
          <br /><br />
          Haru feels comfortable with the Japanese rhythm of life. Punctuality,
          harmony, and structure give him a sense of security. He values ​​the
          balance between work and leisure, even if the pressure of Teiji taisha
          (leaving the office on time) is sometimes noticeable. In his free
          time, he seeks tranquility in Yasuragi no basho (places of peace) – a
          park, a café with quiet music, a flexible workspace at home. Haru
          feels like part of a global, yet local community. He speaks politely,
          helps others, and enjoys small talk with neighbors or baristas who
          greet him with a friendly wazawaza (you're welcome).
