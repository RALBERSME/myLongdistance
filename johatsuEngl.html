          <h1>Japan's Secret to Longevity</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Japan is among the countries with one of the highest life
            expectancies worldwide. In many regions, particularly in Okinawa,
            the so-called "Land of Longevity," as well as in other long-lived
            communities such as the island of Kyushu, the average life
            expectancy often reaches 85 years or more for women and just over 80
            years for men.<br /><br />
            Especially in Okinawa, Kagoshima (Kyushu), Okinawa's neighboring
            islands, and certain rural regions such as parts of Ishikawa,
            Miyazaki, and Kyoto prefectures, there are many centenarians.<br /><br />
            <strong>The Secrets of Longevity in Okinawa:</strong>
            <br /><br />• Hara Hachi Bu: An important reason for longevity is
            the practice of eating only until one is about 80% full, which
            prevents overeating and keeps the body lean and healthy.<br /><br />
            • Social Cohesion: Okinawa has a strong community where people often
            remain socially active well into old age, for example, through
            karaoke.<br /><br />
            • Healthy Lifestyle: In addition to diet, an active lifestyle and a
            generally healthy attitude towards life also play an important
            role.<br /><br />In general, the majority of the very old population
            lives in rural or smaller communities, often with strong community
            ties and a less urban lifestyle. According to international reports,
            there are approximately 60,000 to 70,000 people in Japan who are 100
            years or older. <br /><br />
            The reasons for this longevity are diverse: social structures and
            close-knit communities promote regular social contact and a sense of
            belonging; a traditionally fresh, mostly small meal pattern with
            plenty of vegetables, fish, and less red meat contributes to a
            healthy diet; and an active lifestyle, which is maintained even in
            old age, whether through walks, gardening, or gentle forms of
            exercise.
            <br /><br />
            In addition, cultural rituals, stress reduction through slowing down
            in everyday life, and a strong health awareness play a role. In
            Okinawa, people often
            <strong
              >speak of the "six pillars of health": positive thinking, close
              community, a sense of purpose in life (Ikigai), nutrition,
              exercise, and sufficient sleep.</strong
            ><br /><br />

            Medical care is good, and a culture of prevention and regular
            check-ups contribute to the early detection and management of
            diseases. However, it must be noted that individual values ​​vary
            and the high average life expectancy is partly influenced by
            regional factors. Anyone visiting Japan will nevertheless experience
            vibrant examples of quality of life into old age – a mixture of
            tradition, nutrition, social networking, and an active lifestyle.
