        is Hokkaido's northern metropolis. Anyone who comes here immediately
        feels the sense of spaciousness: wide boulevards, lush green spaces in
        summer, and roofs thickly covered with snow in winter.
        <br />
        The city originated from a seaport settlement. The region's
        transformation from a rural, cultivated area to a modern metropolis is
        reflected in its architecture, layout, and culture. The Ainu culture and
        its traces in the region are an important cultural context, which is
        also visible in museums and exhibitions. <br />
        The Sapporo-Odori route reflects the city plan of the early settlement
        years. There are wide streets and an open area that later became the
        venue for large-scale events.

            Odori Park becomes the stage for the Snow Festival in February. Huge
            snow sculptures are erected there, which are illuminated at night
            with colored lights.<br /><br />The classic Japanese haiku (‰ø≥Âè•) is
            a short form of poetry, a three-line lyric poem. Read a few winter
            haikus: <br /><br />

            <span class="blue">

            At the Nijo Market, you'll find fresh seafood, crabs, sea urchin,
            and Hokkaido specialties. Mount Moiwa and the nearby Teine Park
            offer spectacular views of the city, especially at sunset.<br /><br />
            If you have a sweet tooth, the Ishiya Chocolate Factory is just the
            place for you.<br />
            Or perhaps you'd prefer a cruise with Hokkaido Cruises?<br /><br />
            The Tanukikoji Shopping Street is also a pleasant place to stroll,
            offering traditional crafts, modern boutiques, and cozy izakayas
            (Japanese pubs or bars, often comparable to a tapas bar).
