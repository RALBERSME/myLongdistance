      <h1>Kyoto - the cultural center of Japan</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        For centuries, Kyoto was the cultural center of Japan because it never
        experienced the shifts in capital like Tokyo, thus providing stability
        for art, religion, and scholarship. From 794 to 1868, the imperial court
        resided here, combining political power with cultural priority.
        Monasteries, shrines, and palaces set trends instead of merely
        governing. The city developed its own aesthetic ideal – Wabi-Sabi,
        courtly etiquette, and the finest craftsmanship shaped daily life as
        well as ceremonies.
        <br /><br />
        Religion played a central role. The Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines
        acted as architects of the city's landscape. Thus, there are magnificent
        gardens, echo gardens, and tranquil pavilions. Kyoto was the heart of
        many religious orders, whose monks contributed innovations in painting,
        woodblock printing, ceramics, and music. At the same time, imperial art
        production flourished, from elaborate calligraphy to religious
        sculptures.
        <br /><br />
        Important cultural movements originated here; Kyoto was the flowering
        place of Japanese painting. The tea ceremony (Cha-no-yu) was refined,
        and garden design reached new depths. The Edo period brought further
        impetus, so that Kyoto retained its prominence as a center for
        education, arts, and traditional crafts.
        <br /><br />
        Today, visitors can still feel the traces of this culture of the muses
        everywhere. There are miles of old city streets, geisha districts, and
        traditional crafts, temple gardens, Zen gardens, and imperial palaces.
        Kyoto thus remains a vibrant bridge between historical heritage and the
        contemporary art scene – a place where tradition does not feel
        museum-like, but continues to live on.

      <div class="shinto">
        Shinto is the indigenous religion of Japan, focusing on the worship of
        Kami, divine or spiritual manifestations in nature, ancestors, and
        places. Believers believe that Kami are present in natural places such
        as mountains, trees, waterfalls, and also in specific locations, and
        that they influence the balance of the world. Rituals and festivals
        serve to establish harmony between people, Kami, and the environment.
        This is often achieved through purification, offerings, and music or
        dance.<br /><br />
        Temples (Jinja) and shrines are places of worship where visitors connect
        with the spiritual world through worship and purification rituals,
        prayers, and devotion. The architecture reflects the connection to
        nature and purity. Features include torii gates, simple, clean lines,
        natural materials such as wood and stone, and often spacious, tranquil
        courtyards. Typical characteristics include Taihei or Karamon roofs,
        small half-roofs, vibrant gardens, and the practice of ritual washing
        (Misogi) before praying.<br /><br />
        The temple design invites feelings of stillness, respect, and gratitude,
        ensuring that Shinto remains a vibrant, everyday spirituality.<br /><br />

      <div class="shinto">
        Buddhism arrived in Japan from South Asia and China in the 6th or 7th
        century, initially via Korea. It was embraced by emperors, nobles, and
        scholars, who valued it both as a spiritual doctrine and a cultural
        enrichment. Initially, Chinese and Korean forms of Buddhism influenced
        its development, including the Mahayana schools, and Chan/Zen Buddhism
        later emerged. During the Nara period (8th century), Buddhism received
        state support and was established with large temple complexes in
        Heijo-kyo.<br /><br />
        In the later Kyoto area, Zen Buddhism flourished, and other schools such
        as Tendai and Pure Land Buddhism spread and shaped daily religious
        life.<br /><br />

        According to recent surveys, many Japanese people state that they do not
        belong to any organized religion (approximately 60–70%), while Shinto
        (approximately 3–20%) and Buddhism (approximately 30–40%) are considered
        culturally significant. In surveys, people often identify with both
        Shinto and Buddhism as family or ritual traditions without necessarily
        professing membership in an institutional religion.

      <div class="shinto">
        Shinto is a nature-based spiritual tradition of Japan that focuses on
        Kami (deities of nature and ancestors) and rituals in daily life; there
        is no central doctrine or founding story as in Buddhism. Buddhism is a
        doctrine-based religious tradition originating in India; it emphasizes
        teachings about suffering, karma, and enlightenment, various schools
        (Mahayana, Theravada, Zen), and meditative practice.<br /><br />
        In Japan, both are often practiced simultaneously. People visit Shinto
        shrines for ceremonies and Buddhist temples for rituals such as
        funerals. The two religions complement each other culturally. Their main
        differences are their origin and doctrine (Kami vs. karmic doctrine),
        goal (ritual/practice-oriented daily life vs. enlightenment and
        liberation), and organizational structure (family rituals and Shinto
        shrines vs. Buddhist temples and orders).
