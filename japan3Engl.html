                    Tokyo is the capital of Japan and one of the world's most
                    important financial, political, and cultural centers. The
                    metropolitan area encompasses over 37 million people, yet
                    the core city offers a dense, modern skyline and diverse
                    neighborhoods. Politically, Tokyo is home to the National
                    Diet (Kokkai) and many ministries, while culturally,
                    museums, theaters, and traditional temple complexes coexist.
                    The city is a global transportation hub with several major
                    airports, including Narita and Haneda. Economically,
                    services, technology, media, and retail dominate. Tokyo
                    offers a vibrant culinary scene, from sushi and ramen to
                    innovative gastronomic concepts. For leisure, Akihabara,
                    Shibuya, and Shinjuku attract visitors with shopping,
                    nightlife, and trends. The growth momentum remains high due
                    to urban infrastructure projects such as subway expansion
                    and new construction projects.
