            Breaks in Japan:
            <br /><br />
            Onigiri (traditional Japanese rice balls, made from cooked rice and
            often filled with various ingredients such as fish or vegetables) as
            a quick option (with filling, easy to grab). Bento/Obento as a boxed
            meal: rice, fish/pickles, vegetables; balanced, hearty.<br /><br />
            Soup: Misoshiru (soybean paste soup) or Tonjiru (with meat) â€“ warm,
            comforting. <br />Noodle snacks: Soba/Udon snacks or cup noodles.
            <br />Fruit & yogurt: fruity and fresh, slightly sweet and tart.
            <br />Sweet snacks: Mochi (traditional Japanese rice cakes),
            Daifuku, Anpan (sweet bread with red bean paste). <br /><br />
            Note:
            <br />
            Japanese breaks often focus on small portions (otsumami, snacks)
            instead of large meals.<br /><br />
            Availability varies by region, time, and location (schools, offices,
            and train stations often have different snacks).
