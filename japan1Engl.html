        Why you should embark on this journey through Japan<br /><br />First of
        all, there's the landscape, of course. Within a short distance, you'll
        find diverse landscapes: From the snow-capped peaks of the northern
        island of Hokkaido to the subtropical beaches of Okinawa – Japan offers
        everything in an impressively compact form.<br /><br />
        It's a country that looks back on a long history and has developed a
        vibrant present from it. Temples, shrines, and kingdoms of the past meet
        avant-garde architecture, pop culture, and innovative technology.
        Tradition and modernity exist here in a palpable balance.<br /><br />Food
        is considered an art form in Japan. From sushi, ramen, and kaiseki to
        regional specialties like Osaka-style okonomiyaki or Hiroshima-style
        katsu, many high-quality dishes await you.<br /><br />But aesthetics
        aren't only found on the plate.<br />
        They are also significant in everyday life. Small details with a big
        impact: From perfectly run teahouses to tranquil Zen gardens<br />to
        modernly designed corridors in train stations.<br />
        Aesthetics accompany the travel route in a captivating way.

          What are the essential cultural differences between Europeans and
          Japanese people? Japanese communication tends to be more indirect.
          Politeness, context, and nonverbal cues play a larger role. In Europe,
          direct statements are often common; misunderstandings are less likely
          to occur when using clear, direct language. In Japan, respect is shown
          in many situations through formal address, bowing, and appropriate
          levels of politeness. Europeans apply such hierarchies less strictly,
          sometimes using a more casual tone. <br /><br />
          Japanese culture often emphasizes the well-being of the group,
          harmony, and social peace. In Europe, individuality is more strongly
          emphasized, even in public decisions or expressions of opinion.
          Consumption and daily rituals: In Japan, rituals such as properly
          pouring soy sauce on sushi or carefully placing chopsticks are
          typical. Europeans often experience a more direct, pragmatic approach
          to eating. Private vs. Public Space: Public spaces in Japan are often
          used more quietly; loudness on trains or in cafes is considered
          disruptive. In many European cities, social noise in public areas is
          more common. Gratification and gift-giving culture: Gratitude and
          appreciation can be expressed in the form of gifts, cards, or polite
          gestures – often in more formal settings than in Europe. Great
          importance is placed on cleanliness and punctuality. <br /><br />
          Handling conflicts: Confrontations are generally avoided; conflicts
          are resolved through subtle signals or compromises. In many European
          cultures, open dialogue is more frequently sought.
