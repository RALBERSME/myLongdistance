        Unfortunately, the vacation is now over. It was a long journey, after
        all. I hope you enjoyed it. Look, we're already back home in the US. But
        there is some consolation. Here in this city, there is the 2nd largest
        Japanese community in the US. Honolulu has the largest Japanese
        population in the US, with a population of around 190,000-200,000,
        followed by the Los Angeles metropolitan area<br /><br /><a
